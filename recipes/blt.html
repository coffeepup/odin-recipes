            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The BLT is a classic.  A sublime combination of complimentary textures
                and flavours that has won it a spot on menus across the world.  Heirloom
                tomatoes are ideal for this if you can find them, but regardless of
                which tomato you have just be sure to season it well.
